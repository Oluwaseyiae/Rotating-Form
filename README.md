<h2>A simple calculator with GUI using Tkinter in python.</h2>

<br>

Python offers a lot of options to develop  GUI applications, but Tkinter is the most usable module for developing GUI(Graphical User Interface). Since Tkinter is cross-platform so it works on both windows and Linux. So here i am using Tkinter module to create a simple python calculator.

The fastest and easiest way of developing GUI applications in python is working with Tkinter. So let’s took a quick look on Tkinter.

<h1>What is Tkinter</h1><br>

The Tkinter module (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.

If you work on Linux/Ubuntu then you have to install Tkinter module on your machine for running programs, but on windows you don’t need to install it because it comes with the default python installation.

<h1>Prerequisite For Python Calculator</h1>

For developing a simple GUI calculator in python you must have to prior knowledge of following –<br>

1. Tkinter<br>

2. Lambda<br>

<br>

<b>On this calculator we can perform following many mathematical calculations</b> –<br>

&#9679 Multiplication

&#9679 Addition

&#9679 Subtraction

&#9679 Division

&#9679 Square

&#9679 Square root

<br><br>

<b>And now we will start writing codes for making this. To create this we have to do four things</b> –<br>

1. Importing Tkinter module<br>

2. Creating the main interface(window for calculator)<br>

3. Adding any number of widgets to the main interface<br>

4. Applying the event trigger on widgets

<h1>How to Use</h1>

<p>

1. Clone this repository.<br>

2. Allow execution of the Calculator.py<br>

3. Execute Calculator.py<br>
